First task:
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search
algorithms.


second task:
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to
generate captions for those images.

third task:
Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.
